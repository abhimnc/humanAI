1.Why are you applying to this project?
I began to learn dance few months back to explore new hobby. I am enjoying really much collabrating with people of all age groups. Since I am already working in AI field (computer vision to be specific), I started looking for possibility to explore possibility of AI in dance. I am lucky to find that this year GSOC is sponsoring such kind of projects and I love to be part of it.


2.Do you have any artistic background or creative hobbies?
I don't have any artisitic background but I identify myself as creative technologist and do hobby projects whenever I get time. 


3. Do you have any particular experience with the intersection of AI and art?
I have been working as Research Engineer as Computer Vision based startup.


4. What are some of the potential benefits and drawbacks, in your mind, in incorporating AI into the creative process?
Benefits:
- Enhances human capability
- Increase productivity much more than anticipated
- Helps in Idea generation or act as a collabrator
- Increase the learning process
Drawbacks:
- It reduces the human touch. Sometimes it feels like machines without any emotions.
- It kind of reduces human creative mindset if not used properly.

5. How do you like to collaborate on research projects? (e.g. do you prefer to work independently vs. collaboratively, asynchronously vs. in real time, oral vs. text communication, email vs. Slack, etc.?)
- I likne combination of independence and collabration. Collabrating in a way so that it can enable me to drive the project faster.
- Text communication is preferable over slack. It's easier to respond and communicate. We can keep video meet if require brainstorming or discuss something relevant.

  
6.Do you have any particular ideas you’d be excited to try on the subject of multimodal representations of dance?
- I want to create dance movements of each genre separately like Hip Hop, Jazz, Ballet and can play mix and match.

  
7.(Optional) Anything else you’d like us to know?
- My background in AI will help me code but I can also collabrate with dancers in my local space since I am connected to lot dancers since I am going to dance class.
